Web-Scraping Amazon (Python& Tableau)  - August 2022

● Created a web scraping model to identify and download (CSV) the top 10 products from Amazon across several categories.

● The model was further improved by adding the smtplib module, which sends automated e-mails when the price of a specific product
reduces by 10%.

● Visualized the data to discover a specific month/season to get the best price on products.
